# with aggregate station data over all months from 2019 to 2023. FWHA changed their data
# format in 2022, so the data are stored in two different formats

To measure urbanization, we will use traffic volume as our metric.
To measure environmental quality, we will use climate data 



## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

1. Can we predict environmental quality of a region based on urbanization indicators for that region?
2. Are storm event data and traffic data successful environmental health and urbanization indicators, respectively?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
