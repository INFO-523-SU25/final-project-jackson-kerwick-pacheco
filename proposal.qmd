The goal of our project is to analyze the relationship between urbanization and environmental quality across regions, identifying patterns and anomalies in how urban growth impacts climate-related factors such as storms, temperature, and drought

## Datasets

### Dataset 1 - Storm Data in Arizona 

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false

# Storm Events in Arizona

# Load csv file
df = pd.read_csv('data/StormEvents/storm_data_search_results.csv')

# Print using shape property
print("Shape:", df.shape)

# Print column names
print("Columns:", df.columns.tolist())

# Print data types of all of the columns
print("Data types:", df.dtypes)

# Print summary of the data
df.info()

```

This dataset contains storm event records in Arizona, sourced from the NOAA Storm Events Database. It includes information about various weather events such as floods, tornadoes, and severe storms, along with details like location, date, event type, magnitude, fatalities, injuries, and property damage. It also includes metadata such as time zones, county information, and narrative descriptions of each event.

The dataset consists of a mix of numerical and categorical values, specifically, 12 columns with integer types and 27 with object types. It was chosen for its relevance to climate and environmental analysis in Arizona. The data enables the exploration of temporal and spatial patterns in extreme weather events and supports investigations into trends related to climate change, urbanization, and risk assessment.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)





```{python}

# Traffic data sourced from https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tables/tmasdata/ 
# with aggregate station data over all months from 2019 to 2023. FWHA changed their data
# format in 2022, so the data are stored in two different formats

# storing each year of traffic data as a dictionary of pd.DataFrames
traffic_year = {}

for year in np.arange(2019,2024):
  df = pd.DataFrame()
  if (year < 2022):   
    # old data format
    fname = f'data/Traffic/Station_Data_Extract_Pipe_Delimited_CleanData_{str(year)}.txt'
    df = pd.read_csv(fname, sep='|', low_memory=False)
    # For old format only, remove every entry where state_code != 04 (entries not in Arizona)
    df = df[(df['State_Code'] == 4)]
    df.columns = [x.lower() for x in df.columns]  # make columns lowercase like new data format
  else:
    # new data format
    df = pd.read_csv('data/Traffic/AZ_2023 (TMAS).txt', sep='|')

  df = df.reset_index()
  traffic_year[year] = df

To measure urbanization, we will use traffic volume as our metric.
To measure environmental quality, we will use climate data 



## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

1. Can we predict environmental quality of a region based on urbanization indicators for that region?
2. Are storm event data and traffic data successful environmental health and urbanization indicators, respectively?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
